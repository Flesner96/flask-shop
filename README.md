## 📌 Notes

- ✅ This project was originally a **command-line interface (CLI) app**, then refactored into a web-based admin panel — this transition can be seen in the [commit history](https://github.com/yourusername/flask-shop-admin/commits/main)
- 📦 The current **order system** still uses the CLI-style model: orders store only free-text descriptions and are **not yet linked to individual products** or **inventory tracking**
- 🔐 Admin credentials are hardcoded for now (`admin` / `admin123`)
- 🌐 App is designed for internal/admin use only
- 👨‍💻 Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate Flask full-stack skills with modern frontend integration
